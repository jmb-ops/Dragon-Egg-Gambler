# Dragon-Egg-Gambler
Dragon Egg Gambler is a minimalist, risk‑reward CLI game where you tap a smoldering dragon egg for treasure. Every tap earns loot… but also pushes the egg closer to hatching. Survive the fire, escape with riches, or get melted trying
Dragon Egg Gambler now has its own community hub at r/DragonEggGambler, where players post high scores and loot hauls. If you want to track leaderboard attempts, or just hang out with others who enjoy micro cli games, you’re welcome there.
